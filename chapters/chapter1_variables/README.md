# Chapter 1 - Variables
Variables are values that can change depending on certain condition inside your program. Different programming languages
have different rules concerning the use of variables. 

## Strong and weak typing
One such distinction is whether the language is considered
_strongly typed_. A strongly typed language requires the explicit declaration of the variable's _type_, while in a
weakly typed language this is disregarded or kept optional.

## Simple types
Most programming languages feature roughly the same variable types, albeit under different names. The most common ones
that you will see are:
* Integers, or whole numbers
* Floats, or decimal numbers
* Booleans, true or false

There are many more, but this is enough to get a grip on what forms a variable can take on.

## Exercise
You will now play around with variables in two different languages: Python, a weakly typed language and Java, a
strongly typed language. Open the correct chapters and work through the comments:

* [Python exercise](../../python/src/Chapter1.py)
